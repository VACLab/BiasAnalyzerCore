    "# Using BiasAnalyzer for Asynchronous Cohort Creation and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `BiasAnalyzer` package to create multiple cohorts asynchronously for exploration, which can improve performance and responsiveness when working with large datasets or complex cohort definitions. It complements the [Cohort Exploration Tutorial](./BiasAnalyzerCohortsTutorial.ipynb), following a similar workflow but optimized for performance by introducing asynchronous processing.\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "- **Install from PyPI (once the pacakge is officially released)**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install biasanalyzer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For full setup and usage instructions, refer to the [README](https://github.com/VACLab/BiasAnalyzer/blob/main/README.md).\n",

    "In this tutorial, you learned how to use the BiasAnalyzer package to create a baseline and a study cohort asynchronously for improved performance and responsiveness when working with large datasets or complex cohort definitions. For testing purposes, a `delay` optional parameter is introduced in the `run_in_background()` function to simulate asynchronous execution of long-running process. This tutorial complements the [Cohort Exploration Tutorial](./BiasAnalyzerCohortsTutorial.ipynb), following a similar workflow but optimized for performance by introducing asynchronous processing.\n",
