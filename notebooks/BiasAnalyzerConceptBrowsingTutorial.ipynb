    "# Using BiasAnalyzer for Cohort Concept Prevalence Exploration\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `BiasAnalyzer` package to browse and explore OMOP concepts. In the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) CDM (Common Data Model), a **concept** refers to a coded term from a standardized medical vocabulary, uniquely identified by a **concept ID**. All clinical events in OMOP, such as conditions, drug exposures, procedures, measurements, and events, are represented as concepts.\n",

    "Since each OMOP concept is linked to a domain and vocabulary, it is helpful to first understand which domains and vocabularies are available before exploring concepts. You can retrieve available OMOP domains and their associated vocabularies using the `get_domains_and_vocabularies()` method on the `bias` object. This function returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a `domain_id` and a `vocabulary_id`. The list is sorted alphabetically by `domain_id` and then by `vocabulary_id`."

    "- Text-based visualization (`show_in_text_format=True`): Displays an indented tree with upward and downward arrows to indicate parent-child relationships. This is the default and more robust display mode.\n",
    "- Interactive widget visualization (`show_in_text_format=False`): Uses a `ipytree`-based widget to render the concept hierarchy as an expandable/collapsible tree, ideal for interactive exploration in supported Jupyter environments.\n",
    "  - **Note**: The `ipytree`-based interactive widget may display frontend warnings or partial rendering issues in **JupyterLab 4.x** or above due to compatibility limitations of the `ipytree` widget. Despite these warnings, the tree should remain functional. This feature is optional and recommended to be used in environments where full `ipytree` support is available.\n",
